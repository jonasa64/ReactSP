What is a functional component ?
function welcone(props){
return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
det er JavaScript functions 

What is a Class Component?
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

What is the idea with props?
props bruger man til at dynamisk opdater GUI så man ikke skal have hade coded værdi i sin kode, men varibaler fra fx et array til at output personer. 

Provide a simple example in how you write a Component that accepts props?


Provide a simple example (could be a line from the exercise above) that demonstrates how you pass props into a Component?

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

Would it be possible to rewrite the Clock component into a functional component (provide arguments for your answer)?
ja der javascript 
How do you set new values for state: In the constructor, and all other places?
sætter ny værdi
this.state = {navn : værdi};

ænder værdi

this.setState({
navn: nyVærdi
});

How is it possible to "tell" React that you want the UI to be updated (re-rendered)?
In your component, you can call this.forceUpdate() to force a rerender

What is the difference(s) between state and props
The main difference between state and props is that props are immutable
How do you pass in prop values to a Component
{this.props.navn} 
What is the purpose of React Components Life Cycle Methods?
allows us to update the UI and application state

What is the purpose of this line in the constructor: this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
How can we disable the default behavior of an event handler (for example prevent a submit handler to submit?)
What is the benefit(s) you get from using arrow-functions in a ES6 class?

Unlike a regular function, an arrow function does not bind this and arrow functions have shorter syntax

What is the purpose of the key value, which must be given to individual rows in a react-list
It's recommended to use a unique value from you data if available (like an ID). How do you get a unique value in a map callback, for data without a unique id?

 “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

What is the difference(s) between state and props?

The main difference between state and props is that props are immutable. This is why the container component should define the state that can be updated and changed,
 while the child components should only pass data from the state using props

For which scenarios would you use props, and for which would you use state?
child components should only pass data from the state using props


Where is the only place you can set state directly as in: this.state = {name: "Peter"};
  constructor 
How must you set state all other places?
setState

In a Controlled Component React state is made the "Single source of truth", so how:
Do we ensure that input controls like text, textarea or select always presents the value found in the components state?
Do we ensure that a controls state, always matches the value found in an input control?

What is the purpose of doing event.preventDefault() in an event handler?

The Event interface's preventDefault() method tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, 
its default action should not be taken as it normally would be

What would be the effect of NOT doing event.preventDefault in a submit handler

For example, it could cause a reloading  somewhere else
in the system when you may press submit.
 
Why don't we want to submit the traditional way, in a single page application?
What are the two different ways we can use to make this works as expected for our event handlers?

Explain in words what it takes to implement the "Controlled Component" pattern for a form

An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
